                    Hi, I'm Rachel, and I'm going to be helping you in this coding lesson!"
                </h3> 
                
                By the end of this lesson, you will have written your first piece of Python code!
                
                Before we get there, however, I’m going to tell you a bit about how this is going to work.
                Right now, you’re reading the instructions and below is a text editor where you’ll be able to run any code you write.
                <br>
                <br>
                 Click 'Run Me' to produce your results!  For example, if you
                write code (or a program) that says “Hello World!”, you will see “Hello, World!” in your output.
                <br><br>
                * Note: This lesson may feel very long, so feel free to skim or skip around, according to
                your level of comfort and familiarity with the material!
                <br><br>
                So now, to teach you some Python basics!
                (There are 2 versions of Python, and although they are very similar with subtle differences,
                we will be teaching you Python 2)

            <h3> PRINT STATEMENTS </h3>
            <p>
                In Python, we can print messages to the terminal simply by using the word print, followed
                by the message itself.  So with the aforementioned example, if we wanted to print to the
                terminal “Hello World!”, you simply need to code the following:
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> print “Hello World”
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>
        <div class="page">

            <h3> STRINGS </h3>
            <p>
                As you saw above, we used quotation marks around the message we wanted to print:
                "Hello World!"  This is necessary because in Python, a textual message is called a
                "string", a special type of data (or data type).  Strings can consist of any combination
                of letters, numbers, and symbols, and can be represented in 2 primary ways:
                with 'single quotes' and with "double quotes", as long as they are matched.  Therefore, the
                following are both valid and equivalent methods of printing the same string:
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> print “Hello World”
                    <br>
                    >>> print 'Hello World'
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>

            <h3> VARIABLES </h3>
            <p>
                Furthermore, all data types can be stored in variables that can be defined with any name.
                Python convention, however, is to use underscores between multiple words in a single
                variable.  For example, the below will also print "Hello World!":
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> message = "Hello World!"
                    <br>
                    >>> print message
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>

    </div>
    <div class="instructionsSlide">
        <div class="text">
            <h3> BOOLEANS </h3>
            <p>
                Another data type is the boolean.  Boolean values can only take one of two values.
                In Python, they are represented as True and False, and corespond to integers 1 and 0,
                respectively.  (Note that these are not to be confused for strings "True" and "False")
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> True
                    <br>
                    >>> False
                </code>

            <h3> COMPARATORS </h3>
            <p>
                There are 6 comparators that can be used to compare 2 values in Python, to assess if they
                are equal, less than, greater than, (and so on) one another.
                <br>
                They are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        ==  &nbsp; equal to
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        !=  &nbsp;&nbsp; not equal to
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less than
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <=  &nbsp; less than or equal to
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        >   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greater than
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        >=  &nbsp; greater than or equal to
                    </li>
                </ul>  
                <br>
                For example, the below will output True because the condition is true:

                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> 3 + 5 <= 8
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>
        <div class="page">

    <div class="instructionsSlide">
        <div class="text">
            <h3> CONDITIONALS 1 </h3>
            <p>
                Conditional statements can be written to dictate whether or not, or "if" a following block
                of code should be executed.  The following code associated with that particular conditional
                statement, or condition, is always indented (generally 4 spaces, called "white spaces").
                <br>
                IF statements are an example of this.  For example, the following code would return 'Y' if
                and only if the 'if statement', '1 + 2 == 3' is true.
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> if 1 + 2 == 3:
                    <br>
                    &emsp; return True
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>

    <div class="instructionsSlide">

            <h3> CONDITIONALS 2 </h3>
            <p>
                ELSE statements can be used to complement if statements, and dictate what should happen in
                the case that a paired IF statement is not true.  ELSE statements can only exist with IF
                statements (and cannot exist alone).  For example, the following code would return 'else
                statement' in any case where x is not equal to 2.
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> x = 3
                    <br>
                    &emsp; if x == 2:
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return "if statement"
                    <br>
                    &emsp; else:
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; return "else statement"
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>
        <div class="page">

            <h3> CONDITIONALS 3 </h3>
            <p>
                ELIF is short for 'else if', and dictates whether or not the following block of code should
                be executed, as long as the previous if and elif conditions were not met.  For example, the
                following code would return 'elif statement'.
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> x = 3
                    <br>
                    &emsp; if x == 2:
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return "if statement"
                    <br>
                    &emsp; elif x == 3:
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return "elif statement"
                    <br>
                    &emsp; else:
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; return "else statement"
                </code>
