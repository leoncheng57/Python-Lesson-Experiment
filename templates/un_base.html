            <h3> PRINT STATEMENTS </h3>
            <p>
                In Python, messages are printed to the terminal by using the word print, followed by the
                message itself.  So with the aforementioned example, to print to the terminal “Hello World”,
                one would code the following:
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> print “Hello World”
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>

            <h3> STRINGS </h3>
            <p>
                As seen above, quotation marks are used around the message to be printed: "Hello World"
                This is necessary because in Python, a textual message is called a "string", a special type
                of data (or data type).  Strings can consist of any combination of letters, numbers, and
                symbols, and can be represented in 2 primary ways: with 'single quotes' and with "double
                quotes", as long as they are matched.  Therefore, the following are both valid and equivalent methods of printing the same string:
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> print “Hello World”
                    <br>
                    >>> print 'Hello World'
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>
        <div class="page">

            <h3> VARIABLES </h3>
            <p>
                Furthermore, all data types can be stored in variables that can be defined with any name.
                Python convention, however, is to use underscores between multiple words in a single
                variable.  For example, the below will also print "Hello World":
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> message = "Hello World"
                    <br>
                    >>> print message
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>

            <h3> BOOLEANS </h3>
            <p>
                Another data type is the boolean.  Boolean values can only take one of two values.
                In Python, they are represented as True and False, and corespond to integers 1 and 0,
                respectively.  (Note that these are not to be confused for strings "True" and "False")
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> True
                    <br>
                    >>> False
                </code>

            <h3> COMPARATORS </h3>
            <p>
                There are 6 comparators that can be used to compare 2 values in Python, to assess if they
                are equal, less than, greater than, (and so on) one another.
                <br>
                They are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        ==  &nbsp; equal to
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        !=  &nbsp;&nbsp; not equal to
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less than
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <=  &nbsp; less than or equal to
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        >   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greater than
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        >=  &nbsp; greater than or equal to
                    </li>
                </ul>  
                <br>
                For example, the below will output True because the condition is true:

                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> 3 + 5 <= 8
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>

            <h3> CONDITIONALS 1 </h3>
            <p>
                Conditional statements can be written to dictate whether or not, or "if" a following block
                of code should be executed.  The following code associated with that particular conditional
                statement, or condition, is always indented (generally 4 spaces, called "white spaces").
                <br>
                IF statements are an example of this.  For example, the following code would return 'Y' if
                and only if the 'if statement', '1 + 2 == 3' is true.
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> if 1 + 2 == 3:
                    <br>
                    &emsp; return True
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>

            <h3> CONDITIONALS 2 </h3>
            <p>
                ELSE statements can be used to complement if statements, and dictate what should happen in
                the case that a paired IF statement is not true.  ELSE statements can only exist with IF
                statements (and cannot exist alone).  For example, the following code would return 'else
                statement' in any case where x is not equal to 2.
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> x = 3
                    <br>
                    &emsp; if x == 2:
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return "if statement"
                    <br>
                    &emsp; else:
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; return "else statement"
                </code>
            </p>        
        </div>

            <h3> CONDITIONALS 3 </h3>
            <p>
                ELIF is short for 'else if', and dictates whether or not the following block of code should
                be executed, as long as the previous if and elif conditions were not met.  For example, the
                following code would return 'elif statement'.
                <br>
                <code>
                    >>> x = 3
                    <br>
                    &emsp; if x == 2:
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return "if statement"
                    <br>
                    &emsp; elif x == 3:
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return "elif statement"
                    <br>
                    &emsp; else:
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; return "else statement"
