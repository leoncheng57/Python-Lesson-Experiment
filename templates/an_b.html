************
LESSON 1B :)
************

Congratulations on making it this far!

This time, we'll be letting go of the training wheels and asking you to write
the code fully on your own (at line 24)!

In the following space, use the if/elif/else structure to:
	1) Set a variable, 'day', to the current day of the week as a string.
	2) Print 'It is Monday!' if it is Monday, 'It is Tuesday!' if it is
		Tuesday, and so on ... for all the weekdays (not including weekends)
	3) If it a weekend (Saturday, Sunday), print "It's the weekend!"

Good luck!
Rachel
